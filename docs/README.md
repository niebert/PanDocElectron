# PanDocElectron
PanDocElectron is a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for calling the PanDoc Document Converter on the Command Shell on Linux, Mac or Windows. Or in simple words:
* converting documents is performed by [PanDoc](http://pandoc.org)
* PanDocElectron frees the user from knowing and setting the parameters from the command line.

## 1 General Requirements for Electron
Electron is more or less a brower, that has full access to your filesystem. So Electron/Atom allows to write multiplattform application just with HTML and Javascript, than runs on:
* Linux (see [section 5](http://niebert.github.io/PanDocElectron/index.html#SEC5))
* MacOSX (see [section 6](http://niebert.github.io/PanDocElectron/index.html#SEC6))
* Windows (see [section 7](http://niebert.github.io/PanDocElectron/index.html#SEC7))

If you want to use Electron Applications in general (including PanDocElectron) it is necessary to install the following software packages:
* `git` to download and update the sources of Electron Applications (see [http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/) for installing the software git)
* `npm` to install pre-build packages of Electron as a runtime environment.
* `nodejs` allow with Javscript reading and writing files to the filesystem in Electron.

PanDocElectron itself of
* application `PanDocElectron` and additional packages (see section 2.1)
* a `PanDoc` folder for `Documents` with necessary files to support certain output formats of pandoc.
The necessary packages are downloaded with `git` (see section 2.2).

For running and testing the `Electron` applications in general (like PanDocElectron) it is necessary to install the Electron environment on your Desktop Computer. With electron you download the application that is designed as cross-plattform application and install the Electron Framework for your operating system (OS).

## 2 Requirements for PandocElectron

### 2.1 Installation of Packages needed by PanDocElectron
PandocElectron uses other opensource packages for converting files:
* `pandoc` the swiss army knife for document processing developed by John MacFarlane.
* `ImageMagick` to convert PDF-Slides into web-based Presentation with Audio Comments. ImageMagick is used to create multiple PNG-File as slides from the PDF document.
* `latex` for PDF conversion and processing Latex input files. Convert from a latex document and convert the source into WikiMedia output for Wikiversity.

You can find more details in section 5 (Linux), 6 (Mac) and 7 (Windows) to install these packages.

### 2.2 Installation of PanDocElectron
When git installed on your operting system, you can download PanDocElectron with the following command in the shell:

Install PanDocElectron

> `git clone https://github.com/niebert/PanDocElectron.git`

> `cd  PanDocElectron`

> `npm install`

Install necessary files and folders that are used for generated pandoc output files:

> `cd  Documents`

> `git clone https://github.com/niebert/PanDoc.git`

You choose a location of your choice. The default folder of the support files is:

> ` Documents/PanDoc`

### 2.3 Starting PanDocElectron
You can start PanDocElectron
> `cd  path/to/app/PanDocElectron`

> `npm install`

Those commands can be automized in a shell script (Linux/Mac) or with a batch file (.BAT) on Windows. 

## 3 PanDoc Projects
PanDocElectron uses a project based approach for conversion. A project is a subdirectory of `Documents/Pandoc/` e.g. `Documents/Pandoc/MyProject`. This file contains the input files and the genrated output files by PanDoc. In general the input files are mainly WikiMedia-Files `Documents/Pandoc/MyProject/MyProject.wiki`.
* WikiMedia are provided on Wikiversity.
* WikiMedia is regarded as main input format for content, other inputs formats are possible due to your source content you want to process.

### 3.1 PanDocElectron Filename Convention for converted files in Project
Normally the basename of the input file is the same as the directory name, but this is optional. You can have more than one input file in one directory. From the input document you create output documents in several formats. To distinguish output formats it is necessary to some filename rules. We use the input file `MyProject.wiki` in the input format `WikiMedia` as an example.
* convert `MyProject.wiki` into DOCX File, creates a filename `MyProject.docx`.
* convert `MyProject.wiki` into DOCX File with a 2 Column Layout, creates a filename `MyProject_docx2col.docx`.
* convert `MyProject.wiki` to HTML File, creates a filename `MyProject.html`.
* convert `MyProject.wiki` to HTML presentation, creates a filename `MyProject_reveal.html`.
* convert `MyProject.wiki` to [RevealJS](http://lab.hakim.se/reveal-js/#/) presentation, creates a filename `MyProject_reveal.html`.

The basic version of output format get the standard extension `odt`, `docx` or `html`. To avoid overwriting the files with the same file extensions and underscore filename expand is used (eg. `_reveal` for RevealJS format as an output format with the file extension `.html`.

### 3.2 Project subdirectories
In a PanDocElectron Project 4 subdirectories are created.
* `config` contain the configuration for "Title" and "Author" of the project. Config files share the same basename. E.g. the corresponding config file for  `MyProject.wiki` is `config/MyProject.wiki`.
* `images` contains images of the HTML-document, LaTeX, WikiMedia, Markdown input files and the exported slides from an input PDF presentation.
* `audio` contains the MP3 audio comments for a slide or other audio files used in the documents.
* `video` contains videos used in presentations or in WikiMedia. Default video format is `webm` and `ogg` because they can used for streaming in web browsers and in Wikiversity. Use Firefox Plugin for converting videos in your base format [FireOGG](https://firefogg.org/).  

## 4 Software Development with Atom/Electron
* npm installs packages in `node_modules`. If you have installed  `electron-prebuilt` in that folder on a Mac then do not sync the content in you github repository because others users on a Windows Machine will get confused because the software will create error messages due to the non-matching Operating System (OS).
* Install Atom ([https://atom.io/](https://atom.io/)) as Editor for Software Development in
